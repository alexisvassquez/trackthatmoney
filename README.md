# ðŸ’¸ Track That Money
_An Expense Tracking App To Know Why You're Broke_

**Track That Money** is a Flutter-based mobile app that combines emotion-tagged spending with reflective financial journaling, visual goal-setting, and financial self-awareness.

## Core Features
- Add, edit, and delete expenses
- Tag moods + write journal entries per purchase
- Set piggy bank savings goals
- Visual timeline & CSV/XLSX export
- Emotional insights + spending data analytics/visualization
- Savings goals & financial milestones + achievements tracker (Built for real life: even $1 saved is a win)
- AI chatbot (Juniper2.0) to assist users with real-world financial suggestions, affirmations, and words of encouragement

## Why?
Because understanding and managing your finances shouldn't feel shameful, overwhemling, anxiety-inducing, inaccessible, bloated, or like a sales pitch.

---

## Status
I have pivoted away from building a PWA and am now developing **Track That Money** as a mobile-first app using:

- Flutter & Dart
- Android SDK CLI tools only (no Android Studio)
